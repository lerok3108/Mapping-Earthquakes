# Mapping-Earthquakes
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive map that displays information about eartquakes that happened around the world. As a result, a map was created that allowed users to toggle between three base layers (dark, light and satellite views), included information about earthquakes' location/magnitude and location of tectonic plates. The map also allows users to select to display only major earthquakes with magnitide > 4.5. 
## Deliverable 1. Map with tectonic plates.
